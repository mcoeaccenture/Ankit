Some of the recommended future improvements for the following application are listed below - 

 * UI / Feature specific:

1. Splash screen can be added with a material design icon.
2. Alphabetical index can be added with the list for easy and fast scroll.
3. The list item (album item)can contain more information like image, posts and comments by users.
4. Search option can also be given, with the filter provision.
5. Tapping on a list item can open a screen which has extra (detailed) information on the clicked album.
6. The api should be optimized by giving the facility of pagination, so that the initial api call won't take much time and does not fetch a big chunk of data in a single call.

* Implementation specific:

1. Can add fragments on top of activity, so that we can have a single activity with multiple fragments.
2. The recycler view can be an endless recycler view with load more option. 
3. The adapter can be optimized by giving a provision to add header and footer in the same recycler view.
